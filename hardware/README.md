# Arka Hardware Concepts

This folder contains explorations of Arka-related hardware, including:

- Special-needs-friendly “Arka Device”
- Rugged, kid-safe tablet concepts
- Parental control and kiosk-mode research
- Hardware UI flows
- Optional future open-source hardware designs

This area is exploratory and long-term, but documentation and early sketches 
are encouraged.

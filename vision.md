# Arka Vision

## What is Arka?

Arka is an open, decentralized video ecosystem: a protocol plus a set of reference apps that together form a new, censorship-resistant, creator-first, and child-conscious video universe.

## Problems Arka addresses

- Creators self-censoring to appease opaque moderation systems.
- Children (especially autistic and neurodiverse kids) zoning out in algorithmic junk.
- Governments and corporations able to erase or throttle content.
- Centralized platforms owning the relationship between creators and their audiences.

## Arka’s core principles

- **Free expression within the law** – no political or corporate bias in what’s allowed.
- **Creator sovereignty** – direct monetization, portable audiences, no random demonetization.
- **Child-respecting design** – front-ends that protect and teach, not overstimulate and addict.
- **Open infrastructure** – protocol and reference implementations are open-source.
- **Multiple front-ends** – different experiences for different audiences, all powered by one backbone.

## Long-term vision

- A public, durable record of human video expression.
- A “better YouTube” that anyone can fork or improve.
- Kid-specific and neurodiverse-specific front-ends that use AI as a teacher, not a trap.
- A platform that enables thousands of creators and small projects to thrive without asking anyone’s permission.

Arka is meant to be a **vessel** — a digital ark that carries truth, creativity, and learning through the storms of censorship, chaos, and corporate control.

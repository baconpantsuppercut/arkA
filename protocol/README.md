# Arka Protocol

This folder defines the Arka Protocol — the shared language used by all Arka 
clients, services, and storage components.

It will include:

- Core data models (Video, Creator, Playlist, Channel)
- JSON schemas for metadata
- Storage URI conventions (IPFS, Arweave, CDN)
- Discovery and indexing formats
- Versioning and compatibility strategy
- Message types and optional future API specifications

The immediate MVP goal is to define:
1. The Video object schema  
2. A static JSON index format  
3. A simple discovery mechanism usable by the first Arka web client

# Arka Backend Services

This folder will contain backend service definitions and reference implementations.

Potential services include:

- Index / Catalog Service
- Authentication & Identity
- Creator Dashboard APIs
- Payment and billing integration
- Analytics / events pipeline
- Storage abstraction service (IPFS/CDN uploader)
- Governance metadata service

For the MVP, **no backend is required**.
Future stages will introduce minimal services incrementally as needed.

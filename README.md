# arkA — The Open Video Protocol

**arkA** is an open, community-driven protocol for publishing, discovering, and
viewing video content without centralized control, censorship, or platform lock-in.

arkA is not a platform.  
arkA is not a company.  
arkA is a **protocol** and an **ecosystem** that anyone can participate in.

The goals of arkA are:

- **Free expression** without corporate censorship  
- **Creator ownership** of content, identity, audience, and revenue  
- **Open clients** (web, mobile, child-friendly, special-needs-friendly)  
- **Decentralized storage** (IPFS, Arweave, local hosting, any backend)  
- **Interoperability** via open schemas  
- **A safe, guided child mode** (arkA Kids)  
- **Hardware exploration** for special-needs accessibility  
- **A protocol that no single entity can capture or own**

arkA begins as simple documentation and grows through the hands of contributors.

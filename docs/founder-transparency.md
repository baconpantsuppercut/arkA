# Founder Transparency Statement

arkA exists for one purpose:  
to create a neutral, durable, censorship-resistant video protocol that belongs to everyone.

To preserve that mission, here is a clear commitment statement.

---

## What I Will Never Do

- I will never charge fees to use arkA.  
- I will never close the protocol.  
- I will never embed proprietary dependencies.  
- I will never sell protocol-level control.  
- I will never claim ownership over community contributions.

The protocol must remain universal and unowned.

---

## What I *May* Do (Open-Source Standard Practice)

As the ecosystem grows, I may:

- build optional apps/tools on top  
- create kids-safe interfaces  
- provide consulting or integration  
- develop locked-down child devices  
- accept sponsorships  
- pursue grants  
- create value-added services *outside* the protocol  

These are standard open-source contributor income models and do not affect arkA’s neutrality.

## What Contributors Can Expect

No contributor loses ownership of their work.

You are free to:

- build paid apps  
- run hosting services  
- design hardware  
- offer consulting  
- create tools  
- receive sponsorship  
- teach courses  
- build businesses on top of arkA  

The protocol is the foundation — not the product.

## Why This Matters

Video is one of the most centralized mediums in the world.  
arkA is not a business.  
It is an attempt to build a public, neutral layer for distributing video without algorithms, censorship, or corporate control.

For the protocol to serve the world, it must remain:

- open  
- forkable  
- transparent  
- ownerless  

Forever.

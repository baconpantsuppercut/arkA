# Arka Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phases of development for the Arka ecosystem.

The project is currently in **Phase 0**.

---

## Phase 0 — Documentation & Alignment (NOW)

Goals:
- Define purpose, manifesto, and vision.
- Establish folder structures and project layout.
- Create first GitHub Discussions.
- Create first GitHub Issues.
- Draft core protocols and schemas (Video object, index format).
- Publish roadmap and architecture docs.

No code required.  
No hosting required.

Status: **In progress.**

---

## Phase 1 — MVP Prototype (Static)  
(Aim: get something working in a browser.)

Goals:
- A simple JSON-based video index.
- A minimal “Arka Play” web client that:
  - loads the JSON index
  - displays videos
  - streams from IPFS or HTTP
- No backend services.
- No authentication.
- No payments.
- Documentation describing how to modify the index.

This phase demonstrates the concept publicly.

Expected deliverables:
- `protocol/video.schema.json`
- `protocol/index.schema.json`
- `frontend/arka-play/index.html`
- sample `index.json`

---

## Phase 2 — Basic Services (Optional, Minimal)

Goals:
- Introduce small backend components:
  - index/caching service
  - creator management
  - simple analytics (views)
- Optional: basic upload flow using IPFS or a gateway.
- Publish early SDKs or client helpers.

Focus: still simplicity.  
Avoid complexity until the community grows.

---

## Phase 3 — Multi-Client Ecosystem

Goals:
- Begin Arka Kids prototype.
- Optional: Arka TV app (Roku/AndroidTV/FireTV).
- Customizable client profiles.
- Advanced filtering (safe mode, sensory mode).
- Better metadata and tagging.

This expands Arka into a true multi-experience system.

---

## Phase 4 — Creator Monetization

Possible additions:
- Tips/donations
- Subscriptions
- Pay-per-view
- Transparent revenue flows
- Creator dashboards
- Payout mechanisms

Not required early.  
Will emerge naturally once community grows.

---

## Phase 5 — Governance & Foundations

Tasks:
- Establish Arka governance model.
- Open protocol versioning process.
- Trademarking the Arka name (optional).
- Foundation or DAO-like entity (only if beneficial).

---

## Phase 6 — Hardware Exploration (Long-term)

Research:
- Special-needs-friendly tablet.
- Rugged child-safe device.
- Kiosk modes.
- Parent management dashboards.

Hardware is a “bonus track” that may spawn a dedicated team.

## Status Summary
- **Phase 0:** Active  
- **Phase 1:** Ready for contributors  
- **Phase 2–6:** Future, shaped by community

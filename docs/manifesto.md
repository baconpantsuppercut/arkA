# arkA Manifesto

arkA is a collective attempt to reclaim video as an open medium.

Modern platforms decide:
- what you may say  
- who may speak  
- which truths may circulate  
- which creators get buried  

arkA rejects this.

arkA does not censor.  
arkA does not rank by ideology.  
arkA does not throttle reach.  
arkA is simply **a protocol** for free expression.

---

## 1. Expression belongs to people, not platforms

arkA is built on the belief that communication should not be dependent on corporate permission.  
The world needs spaces where full human expression can exist — even expression some may dislike.

---

## 2. Creators should own their work and their income

You built the content.  
You built the audience.  
You deserve the value.

arkA supports:
- creator-controlled monetization  
- transparent, open interfaces  
- no lock-in  
- no platform rent extraction

## 3. Children and neurodiverse individuals deserve better digital environments

arkA Kids is a priority, not an afterthought.

It aims for:
- cognitive-friendly pacing  
- sensory-appropriate design  
- guided learning  
- no overstimulation loops  
- no algorithmic addiction

## 4. Protocols > Platforms

HTTP, SMTP, and RSS changed the world by being open.

arkA embraces the same principles:
- open schemas  
- open index formats  
- open client implementations  
- open governance  

No corporation owns arkA.  
It cannot be captured.

---

## 5. Simplicity first

The MVP of arkA is intentionally small:
- a JSON schema  
- a static index  
- a tiny web client  
- basic IPFS compatibility  

From simplicity grows ecosystems.

---

## 6. The community decides the future

arkA is not a company.  
arkA is an invitation.  
Anyone may contribute, build clients, fork the protocol, expand the ecosystem or shape governance.

If you are reading this, **you are part of the community**.

Welcome to arkA.

# Arka: High-Level Technical Overview

Arka is a decentralized video ecosystem composed of several major layers:

1. Protocol and Data Layer  
2. Storage and Delivery Layer  
3. Service/Backend Layer  
4. Front-End Clients  
5. AI and Safety Layer  
6. Creator and Monetization Layer  
7. Governance and Development Infrastructure  

This document provides a high-level description of all components required to bring the ecosystem to life.

## 1. Protocol and Data Layer

The protocol defines the shared language between all clients, services, and storage mechanisms.

### 1.1 Core Data Models

Arka will need versioned schemas for:

## Video Object
- id  
- title  
- description  
- creator_id  
- channel_id  
- thumbnail_uri  
- media_uri (IPFS/Arweave/Filecoin/CDN link)  
- duration  
- tags  
- content flags  
- created_at  

## Creator/Channel Object
- id  
- display_name  
- avatar  
- bio  
- associated video ids  
- public keys/wallet addresses (optional)  

## Playlist/Collection Object
- id  
- title  
- description  
- list of video ids  

### 1.2 Protocol Specification

The protocol defines:  
- how clients discover content (indexes, lists, collections)  
- how metadata is published and updated  
- how storage URIs are structured (ipfs://, ar://, https://cdn/…)  
- identity representation  
- schema versioning and compatibility strategy  

Early versions can be implemented entirely using JSON and Markdown.

## 2. Storage and Delivery Layer

This layer stores the actual video content and ensures smooth playback.

### 2.1 Decentralized Storage (Master Copy)

Used for long-term, censorship-resistant storage.  
Options include:  
- IPFS + pinning  
- Arweave  
- Filecoin  

Responsibilities:  
- permanent or semi-permanent storage  
- content-addressable URIs  
- resilience against deletion or manipulation  

### 2.2 Streaming/CDN Layer

Used for fast, TV-quality playback.  
Possible providers:  
- Cloudflare  
- BunnyCDN  
- CloudFront  
- Akamai  

Responsibilities:  
- HLS/DASH encoded streaming  
- multi-resolution playback  
- global caching for low-latency delivery  

### 2.3 Storage Abstraction

A library or service that:  
- accepts uploaded media  
- writes to decentralized storage  
- optionally writes to CDN storage  
- returns a descriptor object with all addresses  

---

## 3. Service / Backend Layer

These services provide APIs, indexing, authentication, and payments.

### 3.1 Index/Catalog Service

Stores searchable metadata about:  
- videos  
- creators  
- playlists  
- tags  

APIs include:  
- get video by id  
- list videos by creator  
- search videos  
- trending/recent lists  

MVP versions can rely on static JSON indexes.

### 3.2 Authentication and Identity

Lightweight user management options include:  
- email/password  
- OAuth (Google/Apple)  
- optional wallet-based identities  

Responsibilities:  
- issue tokens  
- manage sessions  
- link viewer accounts to creators  

### 3.3 Payments and Billing

Handles financial interactions.  
Integrations may include:  
- Stripe (FIAT)  
- optional crypto processors  

Responsibilities:  
- pay-per-view  
- subscriptions  
- tipping  
- payouts to creators  

### 3.4 Event and Analytics Pipeline (Later Phase)

Tracks:  
- views  
- watch time  
- performance metrics  

Feeds data into recommendation systems and dashboards.

## 4. Front-End Clients

Arka supports multiple front-end applications using the same protocol.

### 4.1 Arka Play (General Viewer)

A web application serving as a “YouTube-like” reference implementation.  
Capabilities:  
- content browsing (trending, recent, subscriptions)  
- video playback (from CDN or IPFS gateways)  
- user profiles  
- comments (optional)  
- supporting creators (tips, memberships)  

Creators can:  
- upload videos  
- manage metadata  
- view basic analytics  

### 4.2 Arka Kids (Child-Safe / Neurodiverse Client)

A specialized client with:  
- AI-curated content  
- controlled environments (no open search)  
- structured session flow (video → interaction → activity)  
- low-stimulus filtering  
- optional guided-access modes for tablets  

Uses the same protocol but applies its own filtering and logic.

### 4.3 Native and TV Applications (Later Phase)

- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)  
- Smart TV apps (Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, Android TV)  

All speak the same protocol.

## 5. AI and Safety Layer

### 5.1 Content Classification

Services that analyze videos using:  
- title, description, transcript  
- visual content  
- audio content  

Outputs:  
- category tags  
- NSFW flags  
- sensory intensity ratings  
- educational vs entertainment classification  

### 5.2 Recommendation Engine

Early version:  
- popularity + recency  

Future versions:  
- personalized recommendations  
- learning-path logic for kids  
- interest graphs  

### 5.3 Kids/Neurodiverse Logic

A specialized rule engine defining:  
- session pacing  
- allowed content types  
- transitions  
- break timers  
- reinforcement learning activities  

---

## 6. Creator and Monetization Layer

### 6.1 Creator Dashboard

Tools for:  
- uploading content  
- managing metadata  
- organizing playlists  
- viewing analytics  
- configuring monetization options  

### 6.2 Billing and Payouts

Manages:  
- linking bank accounts or wallets  
- tracking balance  
- issuing payouts  
- generating tax-friendly reports  

### 6.3 Creator Tiering Logic

Defines:  
- free upload limits  
- revenue thresholds to unlock features  
- optional paid plans  

---

## 7. Governance and Development Infrastructure

### 7.1 Repository Structure

- main `arka` repo  
- sub-repos for front-ends and protocol implementations  
- issue templates, PR templates  

### 7.2 CI/CD

- linting  
- automated builds  
- preview deployments via Vercel/Netlify  

### 7.3 Governance Model

Lightweight processes to define:  
- protocol change proposals  
- maintainers and roles  
- conflict resolution  
- version releases

## MVP Summary

The first milestone does not require hosting or backend services.  
The minimal system includes:  
- protocol schemas (JSON)  
- static JSON index of sample videos  
- a simple Arka Play client that reads the index  
- sample videos hosted on IPFS or any public bucket  
- documentation and contribution guide  

This allows the community to immediately begin experimenting, contributing, and expanding the ecosystem.
